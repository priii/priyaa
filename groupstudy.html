       <p class="about-info">In the beginning, we had lot of questions whether it has to be a system or add on to an existing social network or a new app. We brainstormed more than 100 ideas and narrowed it down to 5 ideas.
         We also had some challenges, there are already existing app like slack , what would make our groupie app unique.</p>

<br>
         <p class="about-info">our team recruited participants from the work place and who taje online courses, we realized that many of the students looks for immediate assistance and they are enthusiastic to meet the peer students who take same or similar course and to work together and finish assignment/course along with them. Additionally, we also found that student discontinue the course if they don't get proper assistance or if there is no immediate help it induce lack of motivation. </p>

  <h4> Reflection</h4>
  </div>
       <p class="about-info"><br>When I did the survey, I found major cultural difference. The survey questions were asked in India and california, where as in India
       most of the people prefer buying their grocery by themselves and also they really like doing their grocery shopping. Only few liked the idea of someone getting the work done for them. In california,
     it was totally opposite pretty much everyone wants to reduce the time spent on grocery shopping. However, this app would be useful for working people, students who wants to save money and who have
   no time to find out the best price by themselves.</p> <br>
