         <p class="about-info">WitDeals is a service that helps both busy and not so busy people to make their grocery shopping cheaper and easier. Our intention was to reduce the time that spend in commute and researching best price.This project was for the client, who decided to develop an ios app to make grocery shopping easier.
      My role in this project was to create the experience and the app interface for WitDeals. </p>

         <p class="about-info">In the beginning, we found ourselves a little lost. We asked ourselves a variety of questions: what could we offer that other deal app do not currently have? How can we make the shoppers choose this app? How much time it would save for the user?  </p>

         <p class="about-info">After I interviewed customers in some grocery stores, I realized that customers are pretty much exhausted to do grocery shoppping in the week days spcially after returning from work. They won't mind using an app which creates an optimized itinerary. Additionally, having delivered the grocery to their home will be a plus. </p>

         <h4>Design Process</h4>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
       <p class="about-info"><br><br>From the research gathered, I concluded a couple things:<br><br>
       1. Most of the customers do look for best prices and love to save money.<br>
     2. If there is an app to optimize and to save time customer would consider using them.   </p>

<p class="about-info"><br><br><br>Below is the flow of interaction for the users.  </p>

          <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <p class="about-info">The app interface to be as easy as they write down the grocery list in a paper or even better. Remembering the often bought goods and use of best search engines in the app.
  Although the experience needed to intuitive, I wanted this to be a fun experience involing more graphical icons rather than plain texts.</p>

 <p class="about-info"><br><br>On the login page, the user has an option to sign in (for gender, age range, general region data).However, after loging in the next page
 takes the user to search for the vegetable, fruits they are looking for. It even suggest the name of the product in order to save time that takes to type.</p>

<p class="about-info"><br><br>Once the user created the desired grocery list they can add more or delete the list too.  Also they have an option to enter the quantity of the goods. The next step would be the choice of action
whether they want to do the shopping by themselves or to get delivered. </p>

<p class="about-info"><br><br>Optimized itinerary give two options, the user want to save money or reduce the stops. If it is minimum stops, the app calculate the distance between the user's home
and the closest grocery shop that has the fresh produce that matches the user's list. If it is low price, the user may need to go to more than grocery shops but they will be guided with the best price compared with all the other shops in that location.  </p>

<p class="about-info"><br><br>Getting home delivery, allows user to save time and money at the same time. User can choose the optimized itinerary as low price and choose get delivered
  option to shop witfully. This app also maintains a profile, where the user can check the recently purchased products and when to buy calendar.

  <h4> Reflection</h4>
  </div>
       <p class="about-info"><br>When I did the survey, I found major cultural difference. The survey questions were asked in India and california, where as in India
       most of the people prefer buying their grocery by themselves and also they really like doing their grocery shopping. Only few liked the idea of someone getting the work done for them. In california,
     it was totally opposite pretty much everyone wants to reduce the time spent on grocery shopping. However, this app would be useful for working people, students who wants to save money and who have
   no time to find out the best price by themselves.</p> <br>
